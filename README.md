📖 Description
-------------
The Naruto: The Shinobi Website is a static website project that showcases the world of Naruto, a popular Japanese manga and anime series. This website is designed to provide an immersive experience for fans, with interactive features and a responsive design. The project consists of multiple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, each contributing to the overall functionality and aesthetics of the website.

The website has two main pages: `index.html` and `naruto.html`, with the latter being a secondary page that can be accessed through the `index.html` page. The `index.html` page features a simple yet interactive design, where users can choose their fate by selecting either the "Naruto" or "Sasuke" option. The `naruto.html` page, on the other hand, has a more complex design, with a custom font face and a responsive layout.

The project also includes a `sasuke.html` page, which is similar to the `naruto.html` page but with a different design and layout. The website uses CSS files such as `style.css`, `naruto.css`, and `sasuke.css` to control the styling and layout of each page. JavaScript files like `script.js` and `naruto.js` are used to add interactivity to the website, including event listeners and animations.
